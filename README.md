# Suigh Síos
## Features
### Overview
Suigh Sios is a mobile public transport application for manipulating and displaying information with regards to the capacity remaining in a given bus which is aptly updated in real-time. It is cross platform compatible as it utilizes the Ionic framework 
and Apache Cordova. A Firebase database is what was chosen by my team and I as it is the simplest provider of real-time capabilities.  
The app itself consistes of three views and one modal popup window that displays each buses respective controls. Said controls are available exclusively to the driver application. The passenger app mirrors this version with that functionality stripped out.


~~**Tab 1**~~ **(Completed)**    
This tab holds the list of buses retrieved and displayed from an array of buses stored on a Firebase database. Clicking each navigates you to a buses respective control page with options to increment, negate, and reset seat counts as well as
update the current status of the bus from 'On Time' to 'Late' represented by a colored icon.

**Tab 2**  
This tab is yet undecided. A route map would be interesting, but if it's just a Google Map with nothing on it, then I'd rather deprecate this tab.

~~**Tab 3**~~ **(Completed)**    
This is the settings tab, I made it just to include a cool 'Night Mode' option to alternate between two CSS states.

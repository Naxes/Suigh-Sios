**What is '$scope' in the code?**  
Any time you see '$scope.something' imagine it as 'var something'. That is the simplest way to imagine it and avoid confusion when reading the code.   
It is AngularJS, and is what allows us to call the variables in the HTML really easily like so: '{{something}}'

Down in the blue 'bash' console below, type the following command: ionic serve -p $PORT --nolivereload  
If you are prompted to select between an IP or localhost ALWAYS choose the IP option as this allows you to test its connection to the database.
